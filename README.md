# 📘 Task 07 – Creating Views (Skill-Swap E-learning Platform)

## 🎯 Task Objective

The purpose of this task is to create **SQL Views** that simplify complex queries and help display useful information from the Skill-Swap database. Views allow us to save reusable SELECT queries as virtual tables.


## 🛠 Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- SkillSwapDB (the project database)
- Screenshot Tool (Snipping Tool / Lightshot)
- GitHub (for submission)

## 💡 What is a View?

- A **view** is like a virtual table created from a SQL `SELECT` query.
- It does **not store data** physically.
- It helps to reuse logic and **hide complex joins** from users.
- You can run `SELECT * FROM view_name;` just like with a normal table.

---

## 🧱 Tables Used in This Task

We used the following tables from our Skill-Swap database:
- `Users`
- `Courses`
- `Enrollments`
- `Payments`

## 🧪 Views Created (with Examples)

### 🔹 1. `active_enrollments_view`

**Purpose:** Shows all users who are enrolled in any course.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_enrollments_view AS
SELECT u.user_id, u.name AS user_name, c.title AS course_title, e.enrolled_at
FROM Users u
JOIN Enrollments e ON u.user_id = e.user_id
JOIN Courses c ON c.course_id = e.course_id;

🔹 2. user_total_payments_view
Purpose: Shows how much money each user has spent on courses.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_total_payments_view AS
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_spent
FROM Users u
JOIN Payments p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;

🔹 3. course_revenue_view
Purpose: Shows total revenue generated by each course.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW course_revenue_view AS
SELECT c.course_id, c.title, SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Courses c
JOIN Payments p ON c.course_id = p.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_id;

🔹 4. educator_courses_view
Purpose: Shows all educators and the courses they created.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW educator_courses_view AS
SELECT u.user_id, u.name AS educator_name, c.title, c.price
FROM Users u
JOIN Courses c ON u.user_id = c.educator_id
WHERE u.role = 'educator';

🧠 What I Learned
Concept	What I Learned
SQL View	A saved SELECT query that behaves like a virtual table
CREATE VIEW	Syntax to define a new view
JOIN	Used to combine rows from multiple tables
Virtual Table	Views don't store data; they show live data
Grouping & SUM	Used to calculate total amounts in views
Security	Views help protect raw data by hiding sensitive fields
